1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,023
That's just. Awesome!

2
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:07,560
In the new 23w04a snapshot, they added a new system for improving and customizing armor.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,060
Which has over 700 variations for customization, and it looks very interesting.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,660
But let's take it one step at a time: Do you remember how you got the nonZirite tools?

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,060
You sheared a lot of sheep, crafted beds, and went to hell blowing up tunnels looking for ancient debris,  

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,780
Trying not to get caught in the lava. Sometimes unsuccessfully.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,180
Finding 5 pieces of debris, happily running to remelt them, while trying again to avoid hitting the lava.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,100
Added four gold bars to them,

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,480
Went to the blacksmith's table,

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,160
joined the neserite to the diamond pick

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,520
So you're off to your friends bragging about your new pick.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,860
But with version 1.20, you'll have to fight a little harder to make non-green tools and armor.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,960
Because to upgrade to non-green tools and armor, you'll need to find an upgrade template.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,613
And it will only be in the bastions.

15
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:54,034
You probably understand what might be going on there.

16
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:57,000
Unless, of course, you're in peaceful mode.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,020
After you've found an enhancement pattern, mined naserite, and died a few times.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,840
You will notice that the blacksmith's table is also changed.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,500
It's got an extra slot, it's just used for templates.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,160
Put the improvement template, neserite ingot, and diamond tool there,

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,420
Or diamond armor

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,680
You will receive the long-awaited neserite armor, or tool.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,840
There's also the armor customization.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,000
You'll have to find different templates for her, too.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,060
But thank goodness those patterns aren't in the bastions.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,120
Scattered around different buildings in different biomes.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,280
And the different structures have their own patterns.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,260
Which are not repeated in other biomes

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,900
By the way, some patterns are rarer than others

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,640
But even here, it's not all that simple.

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,720
One of the added templates can only be obtained by killing an ancient guardian.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,902
That's not so easy either.

33
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,940
So all in all, we have 11 new patterns.

34
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,980
So that you don't have to look for these templates several times, we have added pattern krafts.

35
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,900
You will need 7 diamonds, one template, and a block that refers to the template biome.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,200
You need a block of mossy cobblestone to craft the wild template.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Yeah, it's not very cheap, but it can save a lot of time.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,740
Especially for the final game, when the diamonds are plentiful.

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,800
The customization of the armor itself, doesn't add any advantages.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,260
These customizations are all just visual.

41
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,740
To customize the armor, you must put the desired armor into the blacksmith's table.  

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,260
template, the armor itself, and the material for customization.

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,800
The template affects the type of customization, and the material affects its color.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,560
The material can be:

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,536
Neserrite, diamond, gold, copper, lapis lazuli, emerald, redstone, quartz, and a piece of amethyst.

46
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,480
But you can't use the same material that the armor is made of.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,020
So you can't customize iron armor with iron ingot.

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,709
But there is one interesting bug.

49
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,737
If you customize diamond armor with neserite

50
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:43,819
And then pump that armor up to neserite, then the customization stays, which shouldn't happen.

51
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,466
And to me that armor with customization looks more intimidating and cooler than without customization.
